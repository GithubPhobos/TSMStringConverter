# TSMStringConverter
-Program for those, who gets 'invalid input string' message, after trying to import strings from TSM site (or any other source).
Converts strings from 'xxx' format (123,456,789...) to 'i:xxx' (i:123,i:456...)




-Any suggestions for improving the program, for instance if there any other format troubles other than what i've mentioned above,
write me on email (contactphobos@gmail.com), i'll try to implement it.







-If you want you can donate a buck or two on beer, won't complain.
